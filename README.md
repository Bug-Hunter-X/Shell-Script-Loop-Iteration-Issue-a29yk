# Shell Script Loop Iteration Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in a shell script that involves looping through a list of files.  The script intends to process each file in the list, but due to a flaw in how the loop iterates and checks file existence, it might not process all files or might produce unexpected results.

The `bug.sh` file contains the buggy script.  The `bugSolution.sh` file provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description:
The loop's conditional statement may not reliably check for file existence under certain circumstances, possibly leading to skipped files or incorrect error messages.  The provided solution addresses this issue.

## How to Reproduce:
1. Create the files specified in the `files` array in `/tmp`.  Alternatively, modify the script to use files that exist on your system.
2. Run `bug.sh`.
3. Observe the output and compare it to the expected behavior (all files processed successfully or appropriate error messages for non-existent files).
